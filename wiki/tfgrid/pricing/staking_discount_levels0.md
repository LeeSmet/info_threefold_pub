The discount is expressed in relation to nr of months of avg monthly usage

By pre-buying TFT we express our loyalty, it basically means we become like a co-investor in the grid. <BR>
The level of our pre-purchase defines how much discount we get.

Example

I have 120.000 TFT staked, I used 10.000 TFT in one month, which means my discount will be 40% (silver plan)
