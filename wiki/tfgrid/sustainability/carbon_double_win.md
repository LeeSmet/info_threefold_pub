# Carbon Double Win

ThreeFold has as aim to take 2x more carbon out of the air than we put in.

This makes us 2x Carbon negative (see [here](cloudunits_carbon_double_win)).

Saving energy is one thing, but there will still be remaining energy, this needs to be offset by carbon credits.

We work together with Take Action Global to let students farm carbon credits. This has the potential to offset energy usage 100% by the end of 2021.
