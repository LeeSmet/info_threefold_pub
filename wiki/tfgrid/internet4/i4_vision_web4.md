## The Web 4.0 Vision

We believe in a 

![](img/internet_evolution.jpg)

- you in the center of your digital life
- blockchain only needed for specific functions (money, identity, smart contracts, ...)
- internet 10x more efficient
- data sovereignity for all
- an internet created by all for all = **be the internet**

### From Client Server to Peer2Peer

Peer2peer is the most decentralized way to experience our digital life.

- each user has 1 digital twin
- this twin serves your complete digital life
- the digital twin represents you and has all logic required to act on your behalf.
- all digital twins talk to each other over private secure links
- there is no blockchain involved for the compute, storage & network requirements.
- each digital twin needs compute, network and storage resources to survive, the twin will use TFT to reserve and pay for these resources as used on the ThreeFold Grid.
- The twin is the only entity who has control over the resource it requires, its all 100% private and no blockchain involved to reserve and use that capacity.

- There can be unlimited amounts of 3Nodes as well as Digital Twins.
- There are no bottlenecks nor centralization points.
- Our peer2peer network technology takes care of routing and security issues between the Twins and the 3Nodes. The shortest paths is always looked for.

### The Digital Twin Provides your digital life.

- full control over your own digital life.
- experiences to be created using standard web technologies (html, javascript).
- the digital twin delivers the web interface to your (secure) browser.

- no need for information to travel to central datacenters, all communication is fast and private between digital twins. No more client-server.
- all logic of your digital life is 100% private to you running in your twin.
- a secure browser engine makes sure that rendering and javascript execution happens in secure context, give hackers no chance (optional)
- this is super efficient and sustainable, +10x power savings.
- no blockchain required for your digital life = more privacy, performance, green
  - expception: blockchain is needed for digital currencies and as phonebook for digital twins identity.

### Any developer can easily develop experiences

- super easy for any web developer to create experiences.
- the most efficient way how to provide for your future digital life.


### The ThreeFold Grid Provides the IT energy

Each 3Node is an IT Power generator. The TFGrid is the network of these 3Nodes.

Needs to be super simple, just like a solar panel generates electricity.

- The 3nodes do for internet what solar panels do for large scale electricity power plants.
- They allow everyone to contribute to a new internet.
- People investing in the 3nodes are called [farmers](farming_home).
- Each farmer receives tokens called TFT for providing this IT capacity.
- IT Capacity is storage, compute and network capacity for this upgraded internet.
- The Twins need TFT to pay for the IT capacity they need.
