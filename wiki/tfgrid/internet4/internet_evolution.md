## Internet Evolution

### Classic Internet

Everything is structured as client-server model

- The servers run as applications inside huge datacenters using a lot of energy.
- Most of the processes in those servers are being repeated = highly inefficient.
- We exist 100x times, very inefficient.
- This leads to alot of centralization -> insecure, as well as abuse of our data.
- This has been also called web 1.0 and web 2.0

### Blockchain Based 

Blockchain decentralized the server, but in principle it remains a client - server model.

- It is definitely a step in the right direction but the paradigm is the same.
- We as users still exist in different systems and have to deal with different applications (protocols).
- These blockchains can be integrated and through web 2.0 concepts the web application can interact with multiple blockchains at the same time.
- This has been also called web 3.0

The browser has now become our operating system running on javascript. All applications run in our browser and interact with multiple blockchains.

This shows how actually nothing has really changed, the paradigm is the same. The server got distributed out using different mechanism which can be co-owned by more people and be linked to a better consensus paradigm (which often is not the case).


#### some issues with this approach

- blockchain_dillema issue
- Today there are more than 100x different blockchain based projects
- NOT GREEN: lots of duplication of effort and many blockchains are not even green.
- Not private lots of data is publicly available on these blockchains, only encryption can bring some relief.
- Slow, stitching protocol driven backends (blockchain) together in a browser is inherently slow.
- Not secure, hackers operate at the browser level, the operating system came on other level.
- Complicated for the developers, new languages and ways to do everything.
