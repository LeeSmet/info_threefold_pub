# Upgrade VDC Capacity

Your VDC can be upgraded also when it is up and running.

## Extend a Kubernetes cluster

A Kubernetes cluster can be extended with additional worker nodes, through a few steps.

Click on the `Add Node` button.

Choose whether this additional node needs to be exposed directly to the internet with a public IPv4 address.

Choose the way to pay: with a new token transfer or using already transferred tokens (but this will shorten the time before the reservation will expire).
