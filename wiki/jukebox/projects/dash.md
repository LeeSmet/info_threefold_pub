[**Dash**](https://www.dash.org) is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus on the payments industry.

## About

Dash offers a form of money that is portable, inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and in-person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin project, Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments system in the world.
<br/>
<br/>

In addition to Bitcoin’s feature set, Dash currently also offers instant transactions with InstaSend, private transactions with PrivateSend, and operates a self-governing and self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses for work that adds value to the network.
<br/>
<br/>

This decentralized governance and budgeting system makes it one of the first ever successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).
<br/>
<br/>

With Blockchain Jukebox we have crated the ability to easily run Dash nodes at scale and further distribute the network all over the globe, bringing even greater decentralization and data privacy to its DAO infrastructure.
<br/>
<br/>

Dash enthusiasts, developers, and non-developers can use Blockchain Jukebox to be part of the Dash network by running their own Dash full nodes to help secure the network.
<br/>
<br/>

Next step is to add capability of running a Dash Masternode via Blockchain Jukebox for a more advanced contribution to the Dash governance ecosystem as well as getting incentivized by doing so.
