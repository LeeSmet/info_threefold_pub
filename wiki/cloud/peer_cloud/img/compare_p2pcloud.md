## Centralized vs Blockchain vs Peer-to-Peer

In the table below, we list some of the major advantages and disadvantages of centralized, decentralized and peer-to-peer digital networks.

| Centralised Cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Blockchain                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Peer-to-Peer Cloud                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low network diameter (all participants are connected to a central authority); information propagates quickly, as propagation is handled by a central authority with lots of computational resources.                   | The furthest participants on the network may potentially be many edges away from each other. Information broadcast from one side of the network may take a long time to reach the other side.                                    | A peer-to-peer network enables any participant and node to exchange information and value end-to-end seamlessly                                                                                 |
| Usually medium performance (high throughput, normal computational resources needed) and easy to implement.                                                                                                             | Usually lower performance (lower throughput, more computational resources needed) and more complex to implement.                                                                                                                 | Higher performance (high throughput, less computational resources needed) and easy to implement                                                                                                 |
| In the event of conflicting data, resolution is clear and easy: the ultimate source of truth is the central authority.                                                                                                 | A protocol (often complex) is needed for dispute resolution, if peers make conflicting claims about the state of data which participants are meant to be synchronized on.                                                        | Every individual and organization is sovereign. They own 100% of their information and no one else has access to it.                                                                            |
| Single point of failure: malicious actors may be able to take down the network by targeting the central authority.                                                                                                     | No single point of failure: network can still function even if a large proportion of participants are attacked/taken out.                                                                                                        | No single point of failure, the system is decentralized, self-driving and self-healing, meaning the system will adapt and always display required information                                   |
| Coordination among network participants is rather easy, and is handled by a central authority. Central authority can compel network participants to adopt upgrades, protocol updates, etc., with very little friction. | Coordination is often difficult, as no single agent has the final say in network-level decisions, protocol upgrades, etc. In the worst case, network is prone to fracturing when there are disagreements about protocol changes. | Coordination is often difficult, as no single agent has the final say in network-level decisions, protocol upgrades, etc. However, the network cannot fracture due to the self-healing feature. |
| Central authority can censor data, potentially cutting off parts of the network from interacting with the rest of the network.                                                                                         | Censorship is much harder, as information has many ways to propagate across the network.                                                                                                                                         | Censorship is not possible as there is no intermediary and it is impossible to edit information of others.                                                                                      |
| Participation in the network is controlled by the central authority.                                                                                                                                                   | Anyone can participate in the network; there are no “gatekeepers.”                                                                                                                                                               | Anyone can participate in the network and it is very affordable.                                                                                                                                |

Note that these are general patterns that may not hold true in every network. Furthermore, in reality the degree to which a network is centralized/decentralized lies on a spectrum; no network is entirely centralized or entirely decentralized. Peer-to-peer networks enable participants to become the central point of their digital life and to organize the environment around them as they wish. In other words, it provides the freedom to all actors to organize in the most suitable way across the centralization/decentralization spectrum. The infrastructure however remains truly decentralized.
